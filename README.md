# Machine Learning Working Group
**This group is in the [applicant stage](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/issues/11), and as such is currently unofficial**

> Coordination repository for the Rust Machine Learning Working Group (WG)

The Rust-ML working group is currently at an early stage of development, and its prospective role and function in the wider Rust ecosystem is currently being explored. We strongly believe that Rust can contribute to the Machine Learning community with its safety and speed. It carries the possibility of a unified scientific workhorse that combines elegance and performance, in a way normally found only by combining separate languages. We are excited to help the Rust ecosystem get to that point. 

Have some ideas? Let us know! 

## What do we do?

In general, the Rust-ML working group's goals are to:

- Create spaces where people interested in doing machine learning in Rust can meet, ask questions, and discuss their work
- Help organize support for Rust libraries, tools, and projects in the machine learning domain
- In rare instances, to assist with or assume the maintainership of projects important to the wider community

We act as a resource to help people with experience in machine learning to become comfortable with Rust, enable people familiar with Rust to do machine learning, and provide guidance to people with neither. 

## How can you contribute/contact us?

The Rust-ML group has a Zulip chat. Feel free to take a look and say hi!
- https://rust-ml.zulipchat.com

We also host a video chats every two weeks. These meetings are open to everyone, and are regularly announced in the Zulip chat. Meeting minutes can be found in the [Meetings](https://github.com/rust-ml/Meetings) repository.

### Ongoing projects

The following are projects that are currently maintained by the larger Rust-ML working group. Pull requests, issues, and other contributions are welcome! 

- [arewelearningyet.com](https://www.arewelearningyet.com/) 
    - The Rust-ML group helps to maintain AreWeLearningYet by reviewing and accepting pull requests, and submitting new crates to the repository's lists
- [linfa](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/)
    - The Rust-ML group actively develops and maintains linfa, a Rust machine learning framework/library, which fills a similar role as Python's scikit-learn

More importantly, Rust's machine learning community is filled with experimentation! Take a look at some of the projects currently being worked on by members on the working group's [Task Board](https://github.com/rust-ml/wg/blob/master/Task_Board.md), or take a look at some of the project's being discussed in our [Zulip chat](https://rust-ml.zulipchat.com). 

## Code of Conduct

This Working Group strictly adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
